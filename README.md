# linktree

**Objective**: Emulate, as simply as possible, the behavior and appeareance of linktree. This allows to have a second level of links for a given subject, that can be stored and display directly on a repository.

* **links_v1.html**: The first functional version. Mimics the colors and buttons with bare html + css. Does not handle: orientation/smartphones, proper size of button,

* **links_v2.html**: Second version, handles selective orientation. Gracias a:
  * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/orientation : Definir selectivamente segun orientaci√≥n.
  * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11516291/css-get-height-of-screen-resolution : Definir en proporcion al ancho (vh, vw)

* **links_v3.html**: Third version, handles the details of smartphone: proper width and height, text wrapping, and font size. Includes a "linktree version" so its easier to know when you need to upgrade an old link.

* **links_v4.html**: Fourth version. Let's move all the style to a file, so we only need to update that instead of updating all the files, d'ouh! That's why css where invented on the first place, to separate CONTENT from STYLE. It worked OK on local, but then I couldnt make it work in other repos. It was because the css file was relative. So I created a link_latest.html and style_latest.css that test that, and after some tweaking, got it working. But it still needed to use https://raw.githack.com to properly render the css file with proper mime type (shame on you, github).

* **links_v5.html**: Fifth version. Now the version and style are stored in shared common files that will be updated. This means that I wont need to update the "index.html" files again, only the central css + version.html file, if (big if), a new version of linktree arises. 

* **links_latest.html**: The lastest version, the one that should be copied and tweaked into each version.

** Testing it**:
  * Just go to [index.html](https://sebastiandres.github.io/linktree/index.html) or, if at the local repo, click on the file online_test.html.

** To do list**:
* Center div
* Defining and reusing colors
